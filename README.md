GEOMe Chatbot API
Introducing our Educational Navigating Chatbot, a smart, interactive guide that brings historical places and events to life through natural conversation. Whether it’s the pyramids of Egypt, the Berlin Wall, or the Independence of India, students can ask questions and instantly receive rich, engaging information tailored to their curiosity.

1.The Opportunity
Today’s learners are digital natives — they expect quick, intuitive access to knowledge. Yet, traditional resources can be static and overwhelming. Students often lose interest before they find what they need.
